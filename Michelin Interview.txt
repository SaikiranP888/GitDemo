SQL Questions:
1. From two table EMployee  and Dept get the values which are not present in Employee Table.
2. From below table get the output from all 4 joins

Table A = 1 0 1 1
Table B = 1 1 0 0 



Python Selenium Questions:

3. Difference between implicit and explicit wait.
4. Automation testing appproach for username and password and how the details will be stored.
5. Multiply two lists to get one list :
 ABC = [1, 2, 3, 4]
XYZ = [7, 8, 9, 10]
6. To get the vlaue of 1,2 entry from list.
7. How to handle pop up when we are using selenium.



Answers Given by me:

1. EMployee = empID , Name

DEpt = empID , DName

select Name , empID from Employee E NOT IN (select empID , DName from Dept);

select empID , Name from EMployee  right join DEpt  on EMployee.empID  = DEpt.empID ;

2. Inner Join = 1 , 0
 Left Join = 1,0,1,1
Right join = 1,0
Cross Join = n*n

3. Implicit wait is globally defined where explicit wait is specifically defined for one element.
4. Either on run time the details will be asked to the user to enter else if its hardcoded we will give the prerequisite details in the code.
5. Result = (ABC) * (XYZ)
6. ABC[0,2]
7. Just gave the switch.to but didin't mention it properly said switch_to.window


Correct Answers:
1. SELECT Dept.*
FROM Dept
LEFT JOIN Employee ON Dept.DeptID = Employee.DeptID
WHERE Employee.DeptID IS NULL;

2. 
i.Inner Join Output = {1, 0, 1, 1} ∩ {1, 1, 0, 0} = {1, 0, 1, 0}
ii. Left Join Output = Table A + (Matching values from Table B)

For the given tables, the left join output would be:
1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0

iii. Right Join:
Right Join Output = (Matching values from Table A) + Table B

For the given tables, the right join output would be:
1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1

iv. Outer Join:

Outer Join Output = Table A ∪ Table B

For the given tables, the outer join output would be:
1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0

5.
ABC = [1, 2, 3, 4]
XYZ = [7, 8, 9, 10]

result = [x * y for x, y in zip(ABC, XYZ)]
print(result)

6. print(ABC[0:3])
